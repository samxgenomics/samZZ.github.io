# Sampath! Welcomes you!



I am currently working as a Team Lead at the [Global Institute for Food Security, University of Saskatchewan (Saskatoon, Canada)](https://gifs.ca/), where I oversee multiple plant improvement projects. I have been leading my team in developing multiple genome assemblies, high-throughput-phenotyping, quantitative genetics and CRISPR editing. <br>
With over 10 years of experience in crop genomics, bioinformatics, and molecular plant breeding, I have broad interests in plant genomics and genetics. I possess strong domain knowledge and understanding of breeding, genomics, comparative genomics, pan genomics, and other cutting-edge genomic techniques. Some highlights about my skills <br>	 
• Strong domain knowledge and understanding of genomics, comparative genomics, pan-genomics, and other cutting edge genomic technics.<br>	
• Working and managing on government and industry funded projects - developing multiple genome assemblies, high-throughput-phenotyping, quantitative genetics and CRISPR editing. <br>	
• I have solid experience in computational skills with command-line (Linux) interfaces and scripting using Bash, Python, and R. <br>	
• Day-to-day planning and supervising – Post-Docs, students and Technician <br>	
• Designing new projects (writing proposals) project planning and management <br>
